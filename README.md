# Application to test email template

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## üõë Important Note

1. **Do not push your Nodemailer pass on Github** as it can give access to your google email. Use `.env` file
2. Use [Nextjs api routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) for nodemailer transporters and send mail function as they only run on server and cannot expose your google app variables to client.
3. Only use port **`3000`**
